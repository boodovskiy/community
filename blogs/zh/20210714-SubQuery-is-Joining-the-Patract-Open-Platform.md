## **Providing Free Data Indexing for Wasm Tech Alliance**

近日，SubQuery 宣布加入 Patract 开放平台，旨在共同推动公共基础设施建设和合约技术升级演进，发展 Wasm 合约开发生态

SubQuery 是一个区块链数据服务提供者。

我们聚合和整理来自于 Polkadot 和 Substrate 的数据，从而为开发人员提供结构良好的数据支持，使大家能够轻松地、快捷地将数据使用于各种区块链项目中。

SubQuery 可以帮助 DApp 开发人员专注于核心和前端的建设，而不需要浪费大量时间构建用于数据处理的自定义后端，这样可以为开发人员节省更多的开发时间和精力。

SubQuery 可以支持每个 Substrate 或 Polkadot 生态团队处理、查询、转换和存储数据，以此来帮助 Polkadot 或 Substrate 项目构建更好的 DApp。

Today, anyone can query and extract data from Polkadot in a matter of minutes with SubQuery’s free help.

SubQuery believes that contracts are an important part of a thriving Polkadot ecosystem. Providing data indexing services for Wasm contracts has always been a major goal of SubQuery. SubQuery is excited to see that the Open Platform has brought together a large number of great projects, and that everyone is working together to contribute to the healthy and stable advancement of Wasm contracts.

SubQuery will be working with contract projects within the alliance to participate in early trials of our supported contract versions. Providing free data indexing technical support and deployment services. All projects can use SubQuery’s open source SDK to build their own SubQuery Projects, which can then be uploaded and hosted by SubQuery where they run the project and provide GraphQL query services. Secondly, the SubQuery Network will be online soon, and SubQuery will provide all participants with a decentralized and transparent network, to better solve the data inefficiency problem.

Patract Labs believes that the development of Polkadot Wasm contract technology requires continuous supplementation and improvement of infrastructure. SubQuery joins the Patract Open Platform as a data infrastructure provider that complements the need of Polkadot’s ecosystem, providing decentralized data, by liberalizing access, and reducing the operating costs of connecting and applying data in a project. Therefore, developers no longer need to invest a lot of time to build and maintain their own indexing solutions. Secondly, it is difficult for blockchain data to be directly stored in DApps, since DApps need to obtain and transform data from the underlying data source. Thus, the on-chain indexing scheme of SubQuery is a great foundation for explosive growth of DApps in the Polkadot ecology. Currently, SubQuery is also exploring a solution combining SQL tools with Wasm smart contracts, and we are looking forward to it.
