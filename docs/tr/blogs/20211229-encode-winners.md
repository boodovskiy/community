Polkadot'taki lider veri indeksleme çözümü olan SubQuery, son [Encode Club](https://www.encode.club/) Polkadot Hackathon'un kazananlarını sergilemekten mutluluk duyar. Encode Club, hackathonlar ve hızlandırıcı programlar gibi etkinlikler aracılığıyla ekosistemi destekleyen lider bir blockchain eğitim topluluğudur.  [SubQuery, Eylül ayında Acala/Karura ile iş ortaklığı yaparak](https://subquery.medium.com/september-2021-recap-783b9b574b42) 14.000 $ değerinde üç mücadeleye sponsor oldu ve geliştiricileri faydalı araçlar, gösterge tabloları ve DApp'ler oluşturmaya davet etti.

10 hafta ve [Bryan Chen](https://twitter.com/XiliangChen) (Acala'nın Kurucu Ortağı ve CTO'su), [Hang Yin](https://twitter.com/bgmshana) (Phala Network'ün Kurucu Ortağı) gibi Polkadot ekosistemindeki yüksek profilli yargıçların incelemesinden sonra), [Jack Platts](https://twitter.com/jackbplatts) (Hypersphere Ventures'ın Kurucu Ortağı) ve [Sota Watanabe](https://twitter.com/WatanabeSota) (Astar'ın Kurucusu, Stake Technologies CEO'su) [kazananları](https://medium.com/encode-club/polkadot-hack-finale-prizewinners-and-summary-931627c64d9)< paylaşmaktan mutluluk duyuyoruz zorluklardan.

[Hackathon'un Acala/Karura ve SubQuery bölümünün zorlukları](https://medium.com/encode-club/polkadot-hack-challenges-7cfeba1a4c0e), Polkadot'un lider DeFi platformunun gücünü SubQuery verileriyle bir araya getirmeye odaklandı. Geliştiricilerin [Karura SubQuery projesine](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/AcalaNetwork/karura) alışabilecekleri ısınma zorluklarına ek olarak, ana zorluklar bir DeFi botu, bir gösterge panosu veya analiz aracı veya bir Defi DApp oluşturmaktı.

# Bir Bot Bul

Bir DeFi botu oluşturmanın ilk zorluğu, Acala/Karura platformundaki fırsatlardan yararlanmak için DeFi etkinliğinden ve SubQuery aracılığıyla zincir üstü veya toplu verilerden yararlanan bir bot oluşturabilen katılımcılar için 3,500 dolarlık ödüle sahipti.

[Krakura'daki](https://github.com/houtenbos/krakura-bot) ekip, özellikle Karura için oluşturulmuş ilginç bir açık kaynaklı DEX değişim arbitraj botu ile bu mücadeleyi kazandı.  [Arbitraj botu](https://github.com/houtenbos/krakura-bot), iki platform arasındaki fiyat farklılıklarını sürekli olarak kontrol eder ve kârlı olduklarında işlemleri gerçekleştirir.

# Dashboard or Analytics Tool

The second challenge worth $4,000 in prizes asked developers to leverage SubQuery’s data indexing services to build a dashboard or analytics tool based on Karura data. The winner of this challenge was the team from  [Polkadata](https://www.polkadata.xyz/), a data analytics platform for DeFi investors to track how smart money is investing and structuring their portfolio on Karura.

“_The Encode Hackathon provided a great opportunity to connect and collaborate with passionate builders in the Polkadot ecosystem. Everyone involved, including the Encode team, partner organizations, and fellow hackers were all welcoming and exceptionally helpful. Additionally, having clear guidelines and firm deadlines gave our team a sense of urgency that was key for building out MVP._

_The best part of the Hackathon was meeting fellow hackers and having startup thought leaders as advisors and guides for the product we were building. We appreciated the support we received from SubQuery as we worked through the data architecture of our analytics product. SubQuery also provided the simplest way to query on-chain data, avoiding having to build from scratch with API calls_” says Michael Anderson from the Polkadata team.

# Build a DeFi DApp

This challenge featured the largest prize of the whole hackathon worth $3,500 and an overall challenge pool of $5,000.

Entity 54 were the winners in the Defi DApp category taking home $3,500. Entity 54 is a DApp that connects to AMTC6 via Acala API/EVM and reads account balances, loans and allows swaps, transfers, loan adjustments and transfers plus reads coin and loan data. Angelos Diamantis from Entity 54 was thrilled with the result sharing, “_Winning the hackathon has been a fantastic experience. We have been overwhelmed by the interest in the products we are building, resulting in many new industry relationships being established. Going forwards our prime focus is on core product development and a frictionless user experience. Time is the most rare commodity while interchain and Dapp data flow is the development fuel. SubQuery data aggregation and multi-layered analytical products address both. We will be looking to integrate deeper SubQuery offerings within our products as they progress_”.

# Other Notable Entries

We were quite impressed by the work of Defitax, a decentralised platform that helps users stay compliant and get their crypto taxes complete without the need for third-party intervention. Focusing primarily on America to begin with, the team thrive on handling all the complex calculations and intricacies of tax calculations so that you don’t have to.

Shankar Rao Mata from Defitax was already familiar with SubQuery, having started his journey with us as an ambassador and now entering into the Hackathon with a team of other passionate and ambitious individuals. Shankar mentioned of the hackathon, “_The Encode Hackathon was a great experience for us and was the perfect environment for our project. SubQuery was, and will continue to be, instrumental in supporting the large amounts of indexed data that we require in order for Defitax to succeed_”.

With both DeFi and Acala/Karura receiving an increasing level of awareness, we were excited to see the response from the developer community. To get things moving  [SubQuery hosted a workshop where hackers learned how to index blockchain data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUtWC_LZM8Q)  and get a node and query service running in only a few minutes.

Sam Zou, the Founder of SubQuery said  _“SubQuery is thrilled to support the developer community and the next generation of Polkadot projects through Encode Club’s Polkadot Hackathon. SubQuery provides a foundational layer for developers to create game-changing DApps in areas such as DeFi, so we want to encourage people to build tools and applications that take us closer to our vision of a Web3 future”_

After the Hackathon, projects are eligible to apply for a 10-week Polkadot Accelerator programme run by Encode. Many of these projects are right in the middle of this Accelerator and all are invited to apply to SubQuery’s recently announced  [Grants Programme](https://subquery.network/grants).

# About SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/)  is a decentralized data aggregation, indexing & querying layer between Layer-1 blockchains and decentralized applications. This service unlocks blockchain data and transforms it to a queryable state so that it can be used in intuitive applications. It allows DApp developers to focus on their core use case and front-end, without needing to waste time on building a custom backend for data processing. The upcoming SubQuery Network will decentralize and tokenize the ecosystem to allow everyone to participate in the web3 data revolution.
