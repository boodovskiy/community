축제 시즌이 진정으로 우리에게 다가오고 있으며 블록체인은 올해 재미있는 선물을 주는 광기를 놓치지 않습니다! DOT 또는 KSM을 친구나 가족에게 선물할 수 있다는 [Polkadot 발표](https://polkadot.network/blog/introducing-polkadot-kusama-gifts/) 이후 많은 사람들이 이를 활용하여 올해 디지털 자산을 선물했습니다.

이 기능의 좋은 점은 아직 계정이나 지갑이 없더라도 누구에게나 선물을 보낼 수 있다는 것입니다. 이를 통해 온보딩 프로세스인 블록체인 네트워크의 가장 큰 문제 중 하나를 극복할 수 있습니다. Thus, you may not only be gifting a digital asset but also an invitation into the wonderful decentralised world of cryptocurrency.

As Christmas is merely days away, we’re having a look into the gifting data to see just how generous people have been this time of year.

All in all there was a total of 1,364.3 DOT (US$37,791.10) and 18.4 KSM (US$5,100.30) gifted. The luckiest single gift recipient received 5.1 KSM which is over $1,400 USD and contributes to over a quarter of the total amount of KSM gifted. The average gift amount was nothing to scoff at with 3.4 DOT (US$94.20) and 0.3 KSM (US$83.20). As of now, there are still gifts worth over 178 DOT and 0.77 KSM out there unclaimed, maybe Santa got a little lost?

Across Polkadot and Kusama there were a total of 457 gifts sent, with one popular claimer having received 13 KSM gifts. It’s clear from the graph that the gifting ramped up following the initial announcement from Polkadot on the 13th of October, with the peak number of gifts being sent on the 20th of October where 85 gifts were sent that day. In fact, more than a third of the total number of gifts that have been sent thus far were sent during the week-ending the 24th of October where 172 gifts were sent.

What’s interesting to see is the number of gifts not yet claimed is sitting at 84. Perhaps these will be ‘opened’ come Christmas day and we will see this number drop rapidly. Of the 373 gifts which have been claimed, the average amount of time taken to claim was just over 1 day (26.1 hours). Most gift recipients have claimed much faster, but one DOT recipient is still waiting to claim their gift of 12 DOT back from the 15th of October (over 67 days ago!).

So if you’re still in the market for a last minute gift for your loved one, why not send them the gift of Polkadot? Follow the steps listed on the  [Polkadot Gifting](https://polkadot.network/blog/introducing-polkadot-kusama-gifts/)  article and get your Christmas presents sorted so you can focus on what’s most important — the food!
